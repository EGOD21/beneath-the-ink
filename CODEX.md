# Codex Implementation Notes

## Enhancements Completed

- Introduced a reusable `QuoteFormCard` client component to power interactive quote forms with loading/success/error states and Formspree submission support.
- Wired the business and non-profit quote forms to environment-driven Formspree endpoints, including fallback messaging when endpoints are not configured.
- Refreshed portfolio highlights on the landing page to feature three real-world style engagements with measurable outcomes.
- Expanded testimonial coverage with three distinct client voices aligned to the new portfolio and sector focus.
- Added a shared product/process/testimonial data module so both vertical pages inherit the same authoritative content.
- Documented environment setup and project structure updates in `README.md`, plus supplied `.env.example` for easy onboarding.
- Created privacy and terms utility pages referenced in the footer.

## Files Touched

- `components/QuoteFormCard.tsx` - new interactive form component.
- `app/business/page.tsx`, `app/non-profit/page.tsx` - integrated QuoteFormCard and Formspree endpoints.
- `app/page.tsx` - updated portfolio storytelling.
- `data/catalog.ts` - refreshed testimonials.

- `app/layout.tsx`, `components/SiteHeader.tsx`, `components/SiteFooter.tsx`, `app/privacy/page.tsx`, `app/terms/page.tsx`, `app/globals.css` - previously adjusted for site-wide polish.

## Configuration Checklist

1. Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
